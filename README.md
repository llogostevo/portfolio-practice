# portfolio-practice

- created practice portfolio page from a figma file
- aim was to learn how to use figma
- grid used, but the page is non responsive and fixed sizes were used within the grid to match the design provided
- didn't complete the full design as want to move on and work on other designs that incorporate responsive design elements
